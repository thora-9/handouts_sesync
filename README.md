Where: Senegal River Basin

How: Modeling different scenarios of dam management

## Goals for the week

- Download TRMM precipitation data for our site
- Input the NetCDF data into R; combine
- Fit a statistical distribution to the precipitation data
- Create a framework for running Monte Carlo simulations using this data to    incorporate climate scenarios

## Collaborators
